# Non-Framework-Based-News-Website
 This project was limited to using HTML, CSS, and Java Script to code the front end, and Python to code the backend.  
 
 The web app, which pulls its data from the News API (alternative Google News API), has multiple features, 
 including: a formatted word cloud that is filtered from the top headlines to only show the most used words, 
 two news sections separated by news source, 
 and a search feature that allows users to search for relevant articles from a variety of news sources, 
 categories, and date ranges. 
 
 Hosted on GCP.
